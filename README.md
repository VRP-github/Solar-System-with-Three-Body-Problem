# üåå Solar System with Three-Body Problem

A Python-based simulation of a solar system demonstrating the three-body problem using Pygame.

---

## üìñ Introduction

This project provides a visualization of gravitational interactions between celestial bodies, focusing on the Sun, Earth, and three satellites. It demonstrates the classical three-body problem in physics and celestial mechanics, showing how multiple bodies interact under gravitational forces.
